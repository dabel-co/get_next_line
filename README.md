# Get_next_line!

**The aim of this project is to make a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.** 

This project should be compiled with the flag `-D BUFFER_SIZE=X`, X being the amount of characters you wish to read on every iteration of the get_next_line function.!

 **What i've learned doing this project**
 How double pointers actually work, how to use the open / read / close functions and how the file descriptor works.
 Thanks to [Tripouille](https://github.com/Tripouille/GNLTester) for making my life easier with his awersome tests.
